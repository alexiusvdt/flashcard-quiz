thinking about state:

answerVisible: bool
activeQuestion: feed in from firebase db

User stories:
* a user will be presented with a 'type' of quiz they would like to take
  * users can focus within a certain area (eg javascript or react)
  * 

* Users will be presented with a selection of cards that load a question.
* when users click "show me the answer" the card 'flips' to the answer side & user can record if they got it right or not.
* at the end of a round, users will see their total score for that round and whether or not they beat their average
